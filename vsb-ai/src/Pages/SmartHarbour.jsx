                    <p>Are you drowning in a sea of video footage without a boat in sight? Let our object detection and text detection algorithms rescue you! With our expert technology, we can quickly and easily detect and track those elusive boats, even in the choppiest of waters <span role="img" aria-label='ship'>‚õµ</span>. And once we've spotted those boats, our OCR technology kicks in to extract the all-important licence plate numbers. No more manual searching, no more squinting at the screen - just efficient, automated boat-spotting. So why wait? Join our team and help us make this project a reality. And remember, a smart harbour is a happy harbour - so don't be a boat-dummy, use our technology!</p>

                    <p>
                    The project involves several tasks related to the automation of the operation of a recreational harbour. These tasks include:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Scene change detection: Using existing or developed approaches to identify whether a boat is present in an image.</li>
                        <li>Object detection and tracking: Using computer vision algorithms to identify and track the movements of boats in the harbour.</li>
                        <li>Text detection and OCR: Using machine learning algorithms to extract the licence plate numbers of boats in the harbour.</li>

                    <p>
                    As a student, you could work on any of these tasks and contribute to the development of a comprehensive solution for the automation of the recreational harbour.

                <Section heading="A detailed description of the project">
                    <p>The project ‚ÄúSmart harbour‚Äù aims to leverage technology to automate the operation of a recreational harbour in the Czech Republic. The main goals of the project are to monitor the harbour occupancy and to evaluate and register vessels entering the harbour. To achieve these goals, the project is divided into three main parts. The first part focuses on scene change detection, using existing or developed approaches to identify whether a boat is present in an image. The second part focuses on object detection and tracking, using computer vision algorithms to identify and track the movements of boats in the harbour. The final part focuses on text detection and OCR, using machine learning algorithms to extract the ‚Äúlicence plate numbers‚Äù of boats in the harbour. </p>

                    <Card.Body><p>The task of scene change detection (SCD) involves identifying changes between two scenes captured at different times in the same location. In this case, the goal is to use SCD to distinguish between images with and without boats and extract the sequences with boats to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed. This may involve using existing SCD approaches or developing a new approach to identify the visual differences between the two types of scenes. The result of this task will be a reduced dataset of video sequences containing only those with boats present.</p></Card.Body>

                        The other task involves object detection and tracking algorithms to identify and track the movements of boats in a video dataset. The goal is to use a known or developed approach to detect the presence of boats in the images and mark them with rectangular bounding boxes. Because the dataset consists of video sequences, it is important to extend the object tracking capabilities to track the boat across multiple frames. The approach must be able to overcome occlusion caused by poles, people, and other objects in the video. The result of this task will be a bounding box position of the boat for each input video sequence, providing information about the location and movements of boats in the harbour.

                        The last task aims to use text detection and optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms to extract licence plate numbers from images of boats. The input of this task is a video sequence with a bounding box around the detected boat. The goal is to use text detection algorithms to identify the location of the licence plate number in the bounding box. Then, use OCR to extract the number and convert it from an image into text. The extracted licence plate numbers will be used for tracking the movements of sailing boats in and out of the harbour, along with timestamps of these events. This will provide additional information about the operation of the harbour, allowing improved monitoring and management.

                        We have setup of two IP cameras at two different locations installed at the harbour right now. The two cameras aquiered data for several month, the video sequences are divided into the 10 minutes long chunks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The video sequences use FullHD resolution at 4fps framerate. Every video is HEVC encoded, 10 minutes of video is approx. 400 MB of data.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We provide two 10 minutes long video samples from each camera below, you can download 2 hours of example data using the download button below. We can share much more data, just send us an <Link to="/contact">email <span role="img" aria-label='mail'>üìß</span></Link>.
